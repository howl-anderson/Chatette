## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- "rasamd" adapter value missing from console help
- Slot value missing in JSONL examples
- Potential error when using rangom generation modifier

## [1.6.2] - 2019-12-18
### Fixed
- Using random generation name could crash the program in some cases because it was set twice (issue [#31](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/31))
- Several escapable characters (`~`, `@`, `%`, `|`, `{` and `}`) were not considered escapable (reopened issue [#24](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/24))
- `rule` command crashed when called with a number of examples to generate (issue [#29](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/29))
- Parser opened file upon being created rather than when starting to parse, leading to parsing of the same file several types after resetting the system (issue [#28](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/28))
- One escapable character was missing, leading to escape character not being removed for `]` (issue [#27](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/27))

### Added
- When using the JSONL adapter, entities have a new `end-index` field representing the first index after the entity that is not part of it
- Comment at the beginning of each Rasa Markdown output file, stating that the file was generated using Chatette

## [1.6.1] - 2019-11-11
### Added
- New opposite random generation modifier (using syntax `[unit?!randgen name]`)

### Changed
- *Temporarily*, caching is disabled when there are more than 50 units declared, in order to prevent performance issues with large template files
- Rules don't cache their examples at all any longer, as it ended up mostly duplicating caches for very few performance increase

### Fixed
- Escapement characters not being removed in all cases (issue [#24](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/24))
- Entity positions were incorrectly updated in some cases (issue [#22](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/22))

## [1.6.0] - 2019-09-18
### Added
- New adapter to output a *Markdown* file that can be used as input for *Rasa NLU*
- New choice syntax: `[choice1|choice2]`

### Changed
- Shadowing a unit definition (i.e. redefining a unit a second time) is not allowed anymore
- File inclusion is done with respect to the file currently being parsed rather than the master file
- Command `set-modifier` now accepts `randgen`, `randgen-name` and `randgen-percent`
- Running the interactive command line interpreter without asking to parse a file is now allowed, using the command `python -m chatette -i`
- Show the seed used during execution to allow to re-execute the program in the exact same way
- Allow the percent symbol `%` to be appended to random generation percentages
- Accept non-integer percentages for random generation percentages
- Choices can contain other choices
- Choices can now take random generation names and random generation percentages
- Merge word groups and choices together to make the new choice syntax
- Large refactor of the parser and generator to improve the quality, maintainability and readability of the code
- Manage parsing statistics by creating a class intended for that
- Only require `rasa_nlu_data` as a top-level field in base file (not `common_examples` and `entity_synonyms` anymore)

### Removed
- Completely removed the limits on the number of examples that can be generated

### Fixed
- Don't crash when file paths and names contain unicode characters in Python 2.7
- Take random generation names into account when generating all possible examples (issue [#19](https://github.com/SimGus/Chatette/issues/19))
- Prevent some compatibility issues when using different versions of Python
- Double space generated in choices in some very precise cases

### Deprecated
- Deprecate old choice syntax `{choice1/choice2}` in favor of the new syntax `[choice1|choice2]`

## [1.5.0] - 2019-06-13
### Added
- Program option `-f` or `--force` to overwrite the output folder without asking the user for confirmation
- Base file containing predefined JSON data, that can be extended with generated data, when using the Rasa adapter

### Removed
- Drop tests for Python 3.3 because pytest dropped support for it => **Python 3.3 is *not* supported anymore**

### Changed
- Max number of examples per intent to generate (20'000 => 1'000'000)
- Ask for user confirmation before overwriting the output folder. Use program option `-f` or `--force` to have the same behavior as before (no confirmation).

### Fixed
- Command interpreter not working with Python 2.7

## [1.4.2] - 2019-04-24
### Fixed
- Entity marker not being removed from the generated text when the slot starts and ends with whitespaces
- Computation of the maximum number of examples that a choice could generate was 1 off. It could lead to a "sample larger than population" error

## [1.4.1] - 2019-03-07
### Changed
- Make `adapter_str`, `local` and `seed` arguments of the contructor of the facade optional arguments

### Fixed
- Template files were included with respect to the initial master file rather than the file that was currently being read

## [1.4.0] - 2019-02-17
### Added
- Check for circular includes: an exception will be raised with relevant information about which file was starting to get parsed twice rather than the old "too many recursion" error
- Interactive mode, executable using `-i` or `--interactive` program option, with commands that give information or change the state of the parser after it read template files
- Add program option `-I` or `--interactive-commands-file` to feed the script a file of commands that will be directly executed

### Changed
- `jsonl` adapter doesn't create a `synonyms.json` file anymore if it has no data to write inside it
- Output file is written using the default encoding of the platform *Chatette* is being used on, to avoid encoding issues
- Output folder and all its contents are now deleted before being created again to write the output file(s), in order to prevent old outputs from being mixed up with new outputs
- Accept comment lines and empty lines inside unit definitions (not considered as a new rule or as a syntax error as it was the case before)
- Completely refactor the parser and tokenizer: when instantiating the parser, give it the path of the file rather than the file itself. Parsing might behave differently than it used to.
- Move all code that is related to parsing into directory `parsing` and rename file `parsing.py` back to `parser.py`

### Fixed
- Duplicate examples not removed when they were generated by different rules
- Entity values being synonyms of themselves if the same value was used in several different slots
- Number of training and testing examples for intent not correctly parsed in some cases
- Too strict checks on the syntax of choices
- Possible infinite loop during generation (with a lot of bad luck)
- (Invisible) warnings because of invalid control sequences in the code and the tests

## [1.3.2] - 2019-01-21
### Added
- Wiki explaining the whole syntax of template files and the usage of the program
- Examples for the wiki
- Use a built-in `DeprecationWarning` for deprecation warnings (additionally to printing the warning on stdout)

### Fixed
- Possible exception caused by missing import
- Output directory (provided by the user with `-o` or `--output` flag) was ignored

## [1.3.1] - 2019-01-10
### Added
- Program option `-v` or `--version` to display the version number of the module (a `__version__` attribute of the module itself is also now available)

### Fixed
- Missing requirements when installing the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/chatette)
- Casegen (i.e. change of case for examples) didn't apply for some definitions (notably when not asking for a specific number of examples to be generated)
- Version number displayed in help messages in terminal

## [1.3.0] - 2018-12-30
### Added
- Code of conduct and instructions for contributing
- Unit tests for some parts of the projects (automatically run by Travis CI)
- New adapter that outputs `.jsonl` files (choosing which adapter to use is done with the program option `-a` or `--adapter`)

### Changed
- The number of examples to generate for training and testing does not need to be surrounded with single quotes anymore (but still can): `'training':'5'` is accepted as well as `test: 3`
- The output files cannot contain more than 10000 examples anymore
- The output files are now by default put in folders `output/train/` and `output/test/`
- Refactoring of some parts of the code
- Script is now referred to as `chatette` rather than `chatette.run` when executing from the command line

### Fixed
- Using an empty definition now raises an exception rather than removing all generated examples
- Having a line with only spaces doesn't crash the script anymore
- When writing output files in Rasa format, the entity highlighted could be located incorrectly in the example text (if an entity value was used twice for example)
- Possible duplicated examples when generating units with different letter case

## [1.2.3] - 2018-11-22
### Added
- Command line option (`-l` or `--local`) to make the working directory be the directory containing the template file

### Changed
- Working directory to be the directory from which the command is executed

### Fixed
- Missing import in a particular case
- Several error messages that used legacy variables
- `parser.py` changed to `parsing.py` to avoid some computers importing the default Python module named `parser`

## [1.2.2] - 2018-11-04
### Added
- Program option (`-s` or `--seed`) that is used as the seed of the random number generator

### Fixed
- Restaurant example which still had tests within it

## [1.2.1] - 2018-10-22
### Changed
- Accept `train` and `test` as well as `training` and `testing` for the identifiers of the numbers of examples to generate
